**Introduction**

In this project, my objective was to analyze the differences in labor market conditions, education, and demographics across Austrian municipalities of various sizes. What is it like to live in small village and how does it differ from life in Vienna? To conduct this analysis, I utilized data from Statistics Austria, specifically focusing on the 2019 census aggregated to the municipality level.

**Methodology**

I utilized ANOVA tests to examine the differences across 9 variables across the following categories of municipalities:

Villages: These municipalities have a population ranging from 0 to the 50th percentile, with a population range of 42 to 1,140 residents.

Towns: These municipalities fall within the 50th to 99th percentile range in terms of population size, with a population range of 1,814 to 23,841 residents.

Cities: This category includes municipalities falling within the 99th to 100th percentile range (excluding Vienna), with a population range of 24,473 to 290,540 residents.

Vienna: Vienna stands as a separate category due to its unique status as the capital city of Austria, with a significantly larger population of 1,908,104 residents.

**Findings**

The findings from my analysis are as follows:

1. Villages and towns exhibited higher employment rates, whereas cities, including Vienna, displayed elevated levels of unemployment.
  
2. Villages demonstrated a higher rate of secondary education attainment, while larger urban areas showed higher rates of tertiary education attainment.

3. Villages tended to have larger household sizes, indicating potentially different household structures, while cities had a higher proportion of non-Austrian citizens, reflecting the diverse demographic composition of urban areas.

These findings shed light on the varying socio-economic characteristics across different types of municipalities in Austria, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders interested in understanding regional disparities and informing targeted interventions.
